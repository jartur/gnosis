# Cycling 

* "After a 45-minute warmup, do maximal efforts in this order, with full recovery (5-10 minutes very easy pedaling) in between each effort: five seconds (peak neuromuscular power); five minutes (peak aerobic power); 20 minutes (threshold power); and one minute (peak anaerobic capacity). Your functional threshold power is 95 percent of your 20-minute power number." from https://www.bicycling.com/training/a20023337/power-metrics/

# HIIT / SIT

* 4x4 s
* Add short w/o with 3 sprints at "all-out" intensity as per https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2017/06000/Effect_of_Number_of_Sprints_in_an_SIT_Session_on.11.aspx
* Tabata (8x20/10) seems to increase anaerobic capacity, which is a desirable result
