# Questions

* Are explicit & restrictive models of programming that are closer to mathematical proofs pragmatical?
* Why so few people are into FP?
* How to choose a programming language to use in your business project?
* Is OOP any good? Especially in concurrent world.
    * Is OOP more like Literature (organic, imprecise) while FP is more like Maths (analytical, rigid)?
* Should we just relax and do whatever works? Is there actual value in correctness and soundness? 
* Is it responsible to use pure FP in business if you know how hard it is to find people even a little bit interested in any FP at all? 
    * Obviously we can do that for our personal projects / business we own.
    * I personally wouldn't do it even in a position of a CTO.
* Is non pure FP actually as useless as Meijer says? Yes we do need to embrace the fact that impure programs are completely side-effecting. But we are still reducing (not eliminating, sure) the space for errors and simplify our reasoning a bit. I.e. I'd argue it's still better than traditional OOP.
* Am I just stupid? 
    * Well, why is it even a question?
* FP in the small -> pure FP (with IO) -> pure FP (with tagless final + interpreters, i.e. abstracting over effects)

# TODO

- [ ] Read asnd annotate all the papers in the world
- [ ] Study fs2 in detail
- [ ] Study cats-effect in detail
- [ ] Study tagless final more, much more
- [ ] Learn Rust
- [ ] Write IO in Rust? Is it even possible with all the lifetime control stuff?
- [ ] Learn Idris
